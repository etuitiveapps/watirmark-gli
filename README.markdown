Getting Started
---
Generating a new watirmark project is easy. We've taken advantage of several built-in Ruby classes in order to give you a head start and create most of the scaffolding that we've found useful in developing tests against our own websites.

```bash
# develop mode
##check current version
bundle exec bin/watirmark-gli -v
## Or
bundle exec bin/watirmark-gli --version
```

```bash
# develop mode
##create a new project
bundle exec bin/watirmark-gli new my_test_project
```

```bash
## ---(Not yet Implemented)---
## Production mode
gem install watirmark
watirmark-gli new my_test_project
```
